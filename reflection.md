# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
I am a clinical research associate and have been for about 3 years now at a clinical research start-up medical device company researching a medical device used for treating BPH. I went to UCSB and my degree is in Cell & Developmental Biology with a minor in history of art and architecture. I was pre-med and switched to the clinical research after working on a clinical case study with the Weimbs Lab at UCSB looking at the effects of ketogenic diet and entering a state of ketosis on patients with ADPKD.

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
I hope to gain statistical programming skills to help me work towards a career in clinical study design and management and be able to work with biostatisticians and help them best analyze the collected data as well as create the most efficient and effective statistical study plans.

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
What excites me is the whole new realm of data analysis that will open for me as well as further exploring my skills in critical and creative thinking in the biological sciences and ways I can help the maximum amount of people using healthcare. I am concerned about the pace of which we are going to be learning in coding languages and not falling too far behind in my understanding. Hopefully practicing the code will help me the most.
